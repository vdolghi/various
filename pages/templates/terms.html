    <h4 class="mt-2">Legal Requirements</h4>
    <p>You must be 18 years of age or older, to order or receive alcoholic beverages from Programmer's Vineyard. Receipt of shipments containing alcoholic beverages requires the signature of a sober adult (a person 18 years of age or older who is not intoxicated). Wines purchased from Programmer's Vineyard are not for resale, and are for personal consumption only.</p>

    <p>Orders are by credit card only. We accept Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-2">Wine is a Delicate Commodity</h4>
    <p>Wine is a perishable commodity. Wine does not like extremes of temperature: hot humid summer and cold winter weather may adversely affect the condition of your wine during shipment. Programmer's Vineyard is not responsible for, and will not replace wine that is damaged by extreme weather conditions during shipment. When your wine order is picked up by the common carrier for delivery, responsibility for the wine becomes the responsibility of the purchaser.</p>

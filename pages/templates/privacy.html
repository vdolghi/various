However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, our Website or certain areas or features of our Website.  You may choose not to receive cookies from the Service by following instructions in your web browser’s “help” file, but this may make certain features of the Services inaccessible to you.</li>
